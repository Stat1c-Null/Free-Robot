 RINOBER'S ROBOTS PACK

 17 unique robots
 55 character sets in total

 This pack contains:
 - 17 unique robots with numerous variations, of which 2 are human-looking
   robots with several clothing options
 - 5 unique character sets with objects such as gears, a door, crosshairs
   and shoot animations
 - Each graphic comes in two possible styles: one with black outlines,
   the other one with colored outlines for less contrasts. As there are
   also many variations for characters, there is a numeration system
   I stick to throughout every resource pack. See guide below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 USEFUL INFORMATION:

 ---File format:
 All my graphics were originally created and optimized for RPG Maker MV/MZ.
 If you want to use them with a different game development tool, you 
 might need to edit them.

 ---Two styles available:
 My graphics always come in two different styles that you can choose 
 from or combine. I prefer strong black outlines for drawing. However, 
 I also want to provide a smooth style that uses colored outlines for
 less contrast. 
 Graphics with colored outlines, such as tilesets and big character
 graphics (indicated by "$") can be found in the "ALT" (=alternative) 
 folders, and they have "ALT" in their file names as well. 
 Normal-sized character sets are different; they include the alternative 
 version already. In a character set, the upper row is always the one with 
 black lines and the lower row the one with colored ones.

 ---Character numeration:
 Please note that I continue numeration of character sets throughout
 all my resource packs. That means there might be graphics numbered
 "4" or "5" and you're probably wondering where "1" to "3" are. Those
 are part of prior resource packs then. The idea behind this is that
 you can easily import all graphics from several packs to your games
 without the need to rename them, but still find them easily because
 the numeration system remains the same.
 The character sets offer you a whole lot of variation. Many unique
 characters come with several options for clothing, hair and skin color.
 You might want to change your character's clothes from time to time, 
 reuse a certain character in different situations, or just have varying
 NPCs. I think it's a great way to add life to your game.
 Since my aim to provide all these variations results in numerous
 character graphics, their filenames will help you get the hang of it.
 Let's have a look at the following example. It gives you four pieces
 of information: it's a FEMALE character with CLOTHING OPTION 1, HAIR 
 OPTION 2, and SKIN COLOR 3:
 ------------------------------------
 Female_01_02_3.png
 ------------------------------------
 So the basic idea behind my characters' filenames is the following:
 ------------------------------------
 Sex_Clothes_Hairstyle_Skincolor.png
 ------------------------------------
 Some characters might have an X, Y or Z in their filename instead of
 a number for the hair option. It means these are just additional 
 (special) variations I've come up with, e.g. the character holding a 
 weapon or wearing a helmet, glasses, etc.:
 ------------------------------------
 Female_05_X_1.png
 ------------------------------------
 The numeration of non-human character sets such as robots might behave 
 differently because, for example, there is no hairstyle for them.
 I couldn't think of a better way to handle all these variations, so 
 feel free to change the filenames of the files you want to use for
 your game.

 USEFUL PLUGINS:

 If you use RPG Maker MV/MZ for game creation, I highly recommend the 
 following plugins in case you're using my graphics in your game:

 - LORDVALINAR PLUGIN - ANIMATED FACES
   This plugin lets you animate your face graphics when showing a
   dialog, so your character moves its mouth or blinks while talking.
   There is a version for MV, and also a version for MZ.
   Please note: If you want to use this plugin together with my
   face graphics, you need to adjust the plugin within the RPGMaker
   software and make it use "a_" as a prefix instead of the preset 
   "anim_", OR change my face graphics' prefix to "anim_". I prefer
   to use an "a_" as prefix to keep my file names short, so that they 
   won't be abbreviated within RPGMaker. Only face sets with that 
   prefix will be animated in the game.

 - VICTOR'S VE - TILE PRIORITY
   This plugin is a must-have if you want to use large sprites in RPG
   Maker MV. It fixes the issue that tall characters are sometimes
   cut off when standing in front of a tile that is supposed to be
   behind them. Please note that you also need the VE - Basic Module
   to make this plugin work.

 - GALV'S BASIC EVENT SHADOWS (MV) or VISUSTELLA'S EVENTS MOVE CORE (MZ)
   This plugin allows you to add shadows to events and player characters
   on the map.

 - ESTRIOLE'S EST - EVENT GRAPHIC SHIFT EVO (MV) or
   CT_BOLT'S SPRITE EXTRAS (MZ)
   With this plugin you can shift graphics by x pixels. You might want
   to use this option when a graphic (e.g. a door) is not exactly in the
   middle of the event graphic, or just move a cupboard closer to the
   wall, etc.

 - ESTRIOLE'S EST - EVENT SIZE AND TRIGGER:
   This script gives "size" to an event. The specified size of the event 
   is not passable by the player. You will likely need this option for 
   big event graphics such as vehicles, which the RPG Maker would make
   passable around their center (>48x48px) by default. There's also an 
   option to make the whole size of the event activate it.
